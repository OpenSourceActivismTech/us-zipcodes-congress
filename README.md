# US Zipcodes to Congressional Districts

Mapping between US zipcode tabulation areas and Federal Congressional districts.

This is intended to simplify lookup of representatives for contact over the phone, where a simple numerical input is required. If you have the ability to request full address or zip+4, you should.

Caveats:
- USPS zipcodes are not an exact match to Census-designated ZCTAs
- ZCTAs may span states and congressional districts
